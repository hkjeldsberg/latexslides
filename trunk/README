Installing latexslides
======================

Installing latexslides is done by

  python setup.py install

with the usual Distutils options available.

Location of LaTeX files
=======================

As part of latexslides, several style files (*.sty) are provided
in the folder 'styles'. When running the above installation command,
the style files are written to
os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'share', 'texmf', 'tex', 'latex', 'latexslides')
The location can be changed in the following ways:

python setup.py install --install-data=/tmp

The style files are now written to
os.path.join('/tmp', 'share', 'texmf', 'tex', 'latex', 'latexslides')

python setup.py install --home=/tmp

and

python setup.py install --prefix=/tmp

work as usual, the style files are then written to
os.path.join('/tmp', 'share', 'texmf', 'tex', 'latex', 'latexslides')
as well.

Note that the option --install-data only works for the style files, and
overwrite the options --home and --prefix for these files (as it should).

If none of these options behaves as required (for instance, you would like 
to install them to $HOME/texmf), then the variable 'styles_dir' in setup.py 
should be set to this directory.

After the script finishes, you should make sure that the latex command can
find the files. If the files are located in one of the directories where 
LaTeX knows about them, it should suffice to run the following command:

texconfig rehash

To check which directories are available to LaTeX, you can use one of the
following two commands:

texconfig conf

or

kpsepath tex

As a last resort, it is possible to set the environment variable TEXINPUTS,
demonstrated for the Bash shell:

export TEXINPUTS=:.:/path/to/style_files

Note the first semi-colon; it ensures that the systemwide directories are
searched first.

Handouts
========
To convert slides to handouts with multiple slides per page, use the 
psnup command from the psutils package. Here is an example of how to use 
this command:
psnup -Pa4 -4 -l -m10 -b5 -d5 infile.pdf outfile.ps
see 'man psnup' and 'psnup --help'

Authors
=======
Latexslides is based on a package now called oldlatexslides, 
developed by Hans Petter Langtangen and Åsmund Ødegård. 
Ilmar Wilbers redesigned and reimplemented that package partially based
on changes already made by Arve Knudsen. New features were also added. 
All four authors work at Simula Research Laboratory in Norway, 
www.simula.no.
