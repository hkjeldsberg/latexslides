Version 0.2
===========
- Translated exampletalk.py from LaTeXTools

- Added keyword argument 'text' to TextBlock, such that the header can 
  come first. Goes for all Block objects.

- Add beamer styles that are suitable for printing. Same size as on
  screen. Enable by 'colour=False'.

- When running only 'latexslides' create a template file with
  multiline strings that explains how the presentation should be written.

- Avoid stripping Code objects or LaTeX in general. Keep blanks, at least in Code objects.

- Add support for figure=tuple.

- Added a space character after \noindent so that one can write a string
  immidiately after: '\noindentThis is important'

- Possiblility of dumping latexslides to HTML.
  See http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn37.html and http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn-commands.html

- Enabled the uasge 'TextBlock(Code("..."))', avoiding having to write 'TextBlock(' ' + Code("..."))'.

- Prosper: to get the same size as for beamer, we should use hplplainsmall,
  def emp as relsize{-2} instead of \smaller, and fontsize=\tiny in verbatim.
  Figures should be scaled with a factor 0.8 in prosper.
  Fixed using Content.font_scale and Content.fig_scale. Not sure about using hplplainsmall, 
  want the package to be independent of special LaTeX files.

- Added following functionality:
  Should be possible to get the correct output from latexslides
  executable for the correct commands for generating the slides with
  LaTeX. See bin/main.py for ideas.

- Removed sections from HTMLSlides class.
