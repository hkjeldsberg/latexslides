- Add functionality for 'note':
  It would have been nice with e keyword 'note' for a slide. If True,
  the slide is considered a note to be used by the presenter. When dumping
  the slides to file, one could choose wether the note slides should be
  enabled or disabled. The title of the slide should also be proceded 
  by 'Note: '. Enabling/disabling could be done using 
  get_latex(notes=True).

- Make 'block' a keyword argument to Text, Code and BulletList instead
  of having classes especially for Block versions of those. 'blocktitle'
  will be ignored if block=False (which is default). No point in having 
  own classes, and for Prosper this seems weird anyway.

- Implement CodeSlide.
